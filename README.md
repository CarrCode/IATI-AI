**IATI.AI** is an **MIT Solve** solution developing datasets and algorithms artificial intelligent applications need to process **IATI** data published by humanitarian organizations.

## MIT Solve and IATI

[MIT Solve](https://solve.mit.edu/) is an MIT based social good accelerator. The accelerator helps channel support behind innovative solutions addressing global challenges. This year MIT Solve is channeling support behind initiatives helping “communities invest in frontline health workers and services to improve their access to effective and affordable care.”

[IATI](http://iatistandard.org) is an open data sharing framework used by over 800 humanitarian organizations and donors to make detailed information about aid activities, transactions and results accessible to machine applications.

The United Nations and government development agencies are encouraging and mandating IATI to increase the use and impact of data in the humanitarian sector and give communities and frontline health workers access to the data they need, when and how they need it, to make responsible and informed decisions.

## Query Processing Algorithm

IATI.AI is working out how today’s emerging artificial intelligent applications and digital assistants like Alexa can plug into and use live streaming IATI data to answer queries about humanitarian operations to help inform giving and support operational coordination.

The all-volunteer, open source initiative is concentrating on developing an intelligent **query processing algorithm** capable of giving Alexa for example the ability to:

* Break down and understand humanitarian queries
* Identify relevant IATI information fields
* Generate Neo4j graph database query scripts capable of being executed to retrieve data from IATI
* Use retrieved information to answer queries and ask follow-up questions where needed
