# IATI AI

![devices](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATI-AI/blob/master/Media/IATI-Data-cropped.png)

IATI AI is an open source initiative launched by [Humanitarian AI](https://www.meetup.com/Humanitarian-AI/) members bringing students, tech volunteers, private sector companies, academic institutions and humanitarian stakeholders together to develop key algorithms artificial intelligent applications need to process humanitarian aid activity data.

## Focus

The all-volunteer initiative is focusing on carrying out and centralizing the development of specific **algorithms** and **backend utilities** needed to give popular digital assistants the ability to answer complex queries about humanitarian crises and aid operations using information published by humanitarian organizations and donors via frameworks like **IATI**.

IATI is an open data sharing standard and publishing framework widely used across the humanitarian community by over 800 organizations that's supported by the UN and mandated by many government development agencies. It was created to give humanitarian organizations and donors a conduit to use to make detailed information on aid activities, transactions and results accessible to machine applications.

## Microprojects

IATI AI is being implemented through **microprojects** separating research and development work into small, narrowly focused tasks.
